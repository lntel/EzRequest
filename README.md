# EzRequest
## Description
EzRequest is a C++ WinSock2 wrapper which allows you to make HTTP requests using all of the common HTTP verbs (POST, GET). The intended purpose of EzRequest is that it is used for API's. I created this library as I was sick of using libcurl wrappers, therefore, I took a more primitive approach to processing HTTP requests using a library that all Windows machines already have.
